.SH NAME
inets \- The Inets services API.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This module provides the most basic API to the clients and servers that are part of the \fIInets\fR\& application, such as start and stop\&.
.SH "DATA TYPES"

Type definitions that are used more than once in this module:

Returns a list of currently running services where each service is described by an \fI[{Option, Value}]\fR\& list\&. The information in the list is specific for each service and each service has probably its own info function that gives more details about the service\&.

Dynamically starts an \fIInets\fR\& service after the \fIInets\fR\& application has been started\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
Dynamically started services are not handled by application takeover and failover behavior when \fIInets\fR\& is run as a distributed application\&. Nor are they automatically restarted when the \fIInets\fR\& application is restarted\&. As long as the \fIInets\fR\& application is operational, they are supervised and can be soft code upgraded\&.
.LP
A service started as \fIstand_alone\fR\&, that is, the service is not started as part of the \fIInets\fR\& application, lose all OTP application benefits, such as soft upgrade\&. The \fIstand_alone\fR\&-service is linked to the process that started it\&. Usually some supervision functionality is still in place and in some sense the calling process becomes the top supervisor\&.

Stops a started service of the \fIInets\fR\& application or takes down a \fIstand_alone\fR\&-service gracefully\&. When option \fIstand_alone\fR\& is used in start, only the pid is a valid argument to stop\&.
