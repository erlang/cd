.SH NAME
ssh_connection \- 
    This module provides API functions to send SSH Connection Protocol 
    events to the other side of an SSH channel.
  
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The SSH Connection Protocol is used by clients and servers, that is, SSH channels, to communicate over the SSH connection\&. The API functions in this module send SSH Connection Protocol events, which are received as messages by the remote channel\&. If the receiving channel is an Erlang process, the messages have the format \fI{ssh_cm, ssh_connection_ref(), ssh_event_msg()}\fR\&\&. If the \fBssh_channel\fR\& behavior is used to implement the channel process, these messages are handled by \fBhandle_ssh_msg/2\fR\&\&.

.RS 2
.TP 2

\fI{data, ssh_channel_id(), ssh_data_type_code(), Data :: binary()}\fR\&:
Data has arrived on the channel\&. This event is sent as a result of calling \fB ssh_connection:send/[3,4,5]\fR\&\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fI{eof, ssh_channel_id()}\fR\&:
Indicates that the other side sends no more data\&. This event is sent as a result of calling \fB ssh_connection:send_eof/2\fR\&\&.

\fIstatus_events()\fR\&:

.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fI{signal, ssh_channel_id(), ssh_signal()}\fR\&:
A signal can be delivered to the remote process/service using the following message\&. Some systems do not support signals, in which case they are to ignore this message\&. There is currently no function to generate this event as the signals referred to are on OS-level and not something generated by an Erlang program\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fI{exit_signal, ssh_channel_id(), ExitSignal :: string(), ErrorMsg ::string(), LanguageString :: string()}\fR\&:
A remote execution can terminate violently because of a signal\&. Then this message can be received\&. For details on valid string values, see RFC 4254 Section 6\&.10, which shows a special case of these signals\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fI{exit_status, ssh_channel_id(), ExitStatus :: integer()}\fR\&:
When the command running at the other end terminates, the following message can be sent to return the exit status of the command\&. A zero \fIexit_status\fR\& usually means that the command terminated successfully\&. This event is sent as a result of calling \fB ssh_connection:exit_status/3\fR\&\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fI{closed, ssh_channel_id()}\fR\&:
This event is sent as a result of calling \fBssh_connection:close/2\fR\&\&. Both the handling of this event and sending it are taken care of by the \fBssh_channel\fR\& behavior\&.
.RE
.TP 2
.B
\fIterminal_events()\fR\&:
Channels implementing a shell and command execution on the server side are to handle the following messages that can be sent by client- channel processes\&.
.RS 2
.LP
Events that include a \fIWantReply\fR\& expect the event handling process to call \fB ssh_connection:reply_request/4\fR\& with the boolean value of \fIWantReply\fR\& as the second argument\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fI{env, ssh_channel_id(), WantReply :: boolean(), Var ::string(), Value :: string()}\fR\&:
Environment variables can be passed to the shell/command to be started later\&. This event is sent as a result of calling \fB ssh_connection:setenv/5\fR\&\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fI{pty, ssh_channel_id(), WantReply :: boolean(), {Terminal :: string(), CharWidth :: integer(), RowHeight :: integer(), PixelWidth :: integer(), PixelHeight :: integer(), TerminalModes :: [{Opcode :: atom() | integer(), Value :: integer()}]}}\fR\&:
A pseudo-terminal has been requested for the session\&. \fITerminal\fR\& is the value of the TERM environment variable value, that is, \fIvt100\fR\&\&. Zero dimension parameters must be ignored\&. The character/row dimensions override the pixel dimensions (when non-zero)\&. Pixel dimensions refer to the drawable area of the window\&. \fIOpcode\fR\& in the \fITerminalModes\fR\& list is the mnemonic name, represented as a lowercase Erlang atom, defined in RFC 4254, Section 8\&. It can also be an \fIOpcode\fR\& if the mnemonic name is not listed in the RFC\&. Example: \fIOP code: 53, mnemonic name ECHO erlang atom: echo\fR\&\&. This event is sent as a result of calling \fBssh_connection:ptty_alloc/4\fR\&\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fI{shell, WantReply :: boolean()}\fR\&:
This message requests that the user default shell is started at the other end\&. This event is sent as a result of calling \fB ssh_connection:shell/2\fR\&\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fI{window_change, ssh_channel_id(), CharWidth() :: integer(), RowHeight :: integer(), PixWidth :: integer(), PixHeight :: integer()}\fR\&:
When the window (terminal) size changes on the client side, it \fIcan\fR\& send a message to the server side to inform it of the new dimensions\&. No API function generates this event\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fI{exec, ssh_channel_id(), WantReply :: boolean(), Cmd :: string()}\fR\&:
This message requests that the server starts execution of the given command\&. This event is sent as a result of calling \fBssh_connection:exec/4 \fR\&\&.
