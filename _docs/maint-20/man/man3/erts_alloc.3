.SH NAME
erts_alloc \- An Erlang runtime system internal memory allocator library.
  
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fIerts_alloc\fR\& is an Erlang runtime system internal memory allocator library\&. \fIerts_alloc\fR\& provides the Erlang runtime system with a number of memory allocators\&.
.SH "ALLOCATORS"

.LP
The following allocators are present:
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fItemp_alloc\fR\&:
Allocator used for temporary allocations\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIeheap_alloc\fR\&:
Allocator used for Erlang heap data, such as Erlang process heaps\&. 
.TP 2
.B
\fIbinary_alloc\fR\&:
Allocator used for Erlang binary data\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIets_alloc\fR\&:
Allocator used for \fIets\fR\& data\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIdriver_alloc\fR\&:
Allocator used for driver data\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIliteral_alloc\fR\&:
Allocator used for constant terms in Erlang code\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIsl_alloc\fR\&:
Allocator used for memory blocks that are expected to be short-lived\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIll_alloc\fR\&:
Allocator used for memory blocks that are expected to be long-lived, for example, Erlang code\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIfix_alloc\fR\&:
A fast allocator used for some frequently used fixed size data types\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIexec_alloc\fR\&:
Allocator used by the \fB\fIHiPE\fR\&\fR\& application for native executable code on specific architectures (x86_64)\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIstd_alloc\fR\&:
Allocator used for most memory blocks not allocated through any of the other allocators described above\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIsys_alloc\fR\&:
This is normally the default \fImalloc\fR\& implementation used on the specific OS\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fImseg_alloc\fR\&:
A memory segment allocator\&. It is used by other allocators for allocating memory segments and is only available on systems that have the \fImmap\fR\& system call\&. Memory segments that are deallocated are kept for a while in a segment cache before they are destroyed\&. When segments are allocated, cached segments are used if possible instead of creating new segments\&. This to reduce the number of system calls made\&.
.RE
.LP
\fIsys_alloc\fR\& and \fIliteral_alloc\fR\& are always enabled and cannot be disabled\&. \fIexec_alloc\fR\& is only available if it is needed and cannot be disabled\&. \fImseg_alloc\fR\& is always enabled if it is available and an allocator that uses it is enabled\&. All other allocators can be \fBenabled or disabled\fR\&\&. By default all allocators are enabled\&. When an allocator is disabled, \fIsys_alloc\fR\& is used instead of the disabled allocator\&.
.LP
The main idea with the \fIerts_alloc\fR\& library is to separate memory blocks that are used differently into different memory areas, to achieve less memory fragmentation\&. By putting less effort in finding a good fit for memory blocks that are frequently allocated than for those less frequently allocated, a performance gain can be achieved\&.
.SH "THE ALLOC_UTIL FRAMEWORK"

.LP
Internally a framework called \fIalloc_util\fR\& is used for implementing allocators\&. \fIsys_alloc\fR\& and \fImseg_alloc\fR\& do not use this framework, so the following does \fInot\fR\& apply to them\&.
.LP
An allocator manages multiple areas, called carriers, in which memory blocks are placed\&. A carrier is either placed in a separate memory segment (allocated through \fImseg_alloc\fR\&), or in the heap segment (allocated through \fIsys_alloc\fR\&)\&.
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
Multiblock carriers are used for storage of several blocks\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
Singleblock carriers are used for storage of one block\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
Blocks that are larger than the value of the singleblock carrier threshold (\fB\fIsbct\fR\&\fR\&) parameter are placed in singleblock carriers\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
Blocks that are smaller than the value of parameter \fIsbct\fR\& are placed in multiblock carriers\&.
.LP
.RE

.LP
Normally an allocator creates a "main multiblock carrier"\&. Main multiblock carriers are never deallocated\&. The size of the main multiblock carrier is determined by the value of parameter \fB\fImmbcs\fR\&\fR\&\&.
.LP
Sizes of multiblock carriers allocated through \fImseg_alloc\fR\& are decided based on the following parameters:
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
The values of the largest multiblock carrier size (\fB\fIlmbcs\fR\&\fR\&)
.LP
.TP 2
*
The smallest multiblock carrier size (\fB\fIsmbcs\fR\&\fR\&)
.LP
.TP 2
*
The multiblock carrier growth stages (\fB\fImbcgs\fR\&\fR\&)
.LP
.RE

.LP
If \fInc\fR\& is the current number of multiblock carriers (the main multiblock carrier excluded) managed by an allocator, the size of the next \fImseg_alloc\fR\& multiblock carrier allocated by this allocator is roughly \fIsmbcs+nc*(lmbcs-smbcs)/mbcgs\fR\& when \fInc <= mbcgs\fR\&, and \fIlmbcs\fR\& when \fInc > mbcgs\fR\&\&. If the value of parameter \fIsbct\fR\& is larger than the value of parameter \fIlmbcs\fR\&, the allocator may have to create multiblock carriers that are larger than the value of parameter \fIlmbcs\fR\&, though\&. Singleblock carriers allocated through \fImseg_alloc\fR\& are sized to whole pages\&.
.LP
Sizes of carriers allocated through \fIsys_alloc\fR\& are decided based on the value of the \fIsys_alloc\fR\& carrier size (\fB\fIycs\fR\&\fR\&) parameter\&. The size of a carrier is the least number of multiples of the value of parameter \fIycs\fR\& satisfying the request\&.
.LP
Coalescing of free blocks are always performed immediately\&. Boundary tags (headers and footers) in free blocks are used, which makes the time complexity for coalescing constant\&.
.LP
The memory allocation strategy used for multiblock carriers by an allocator can be configured using parameter \fB\fIas\fR\&\fR\&\&. The following strategies are available:
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
Best fit:
Strategy: Find the smallest block satisfying the requested block size\&.
.RS 2
.LP
Implementation: A balanced binary search tree is used\&. The time complexity is proportional to log N, where N is the number of sizes of free blocks\&.

.RE
.TP 2

Good fit:
Strategy: Try to find the best fit, but settle for the best fit found during a limited search\&.
.RS 2
.LP
Implementation: The implementation uses segregated free lists with a maximum block search depth (in each list) to find a good fit fast\&. When the maximum block search depth is small (by default 3), this implementation has a time complexity that is constant\&. The maximum block search depth can be configured using parameter \fB\fImbsd\fR\&\fR\&\&.
.RE
.TP 2
.B
A fit:
Strategy: Do not search for a fit, inspect only one free block to see if it satisfies the request\&. This strategy is only intended to be used for temporary allocations\&.
.RS 2
.LP
Implementation: Inspect the first block in a free-list\&. If it satisfies the request, it is used, otherwise a new carrier is created\&. The implementation has a time complexity that is constant\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
As from ERTS 5\&.6\&.1 the emulator refuses to use this strategy on other allocators than \fItemp_alloc\fR\&\&. This because it only causes problems for other allocators\&.
.RE
.RE
.LP
Apart from the ordinary allocators described above, some pre-allocators are used for some specific data types\&. These pre-allocators pre-allocate a fixed amount of memory for certain data types when the runtime system starts\&. As long as pre-allocated memory is available, it is used\&. When no pre-allocated memory is available, memory is allocated in ordinary allocators\&. These pre-allocators are typically much faster than the ordinary allocators, but can only satisfy a limited number of requests\&.

Sets \fBsuper carrier\fR\& only flag\&. Defaults to \fItrue\fR\&\&. When a super carrier is used and this flag is \fItrue\fR\&, \fImseg_alloc\fR\& only creates carriers in the super carrier\&. Notice that the \fIalloc_util\fR\& framework can create \fIsys_alloc\fR\& carriers, so if you want all carriers to be created in the super carrier, you therefore want to disable use of \fIsys_alloc\fR\& carriers by also passing \fB\fI+Musac false\fR\&\fR\&\&.

This parameter determines the amount of memory to reserve for free segment descriptors used by the super carrier\&. If the system runs out of reserved memory for free segment descriptors, other memory is used\&. This can however cause fragmentation issues, so you want to ensure that this never happens\&. The maximum amount of free segment descriptors used can be retrieved from the \fIerts_mmap\fR\& tuple part of the result from calling \fB\fIerlang:system_info({allocator, mseg_alloc})\fR\&\fR\&\&.

\fI+MMscrpm true|false\fR\&:
Sets \fBsuper carrier\fR\& reserve physical memory flag\&. Defaults to \fItrue\fR\&\&. When this flag is \fItrue\fR\&, physical memory is reserved for the whole super carrier at once when it is created\&. The reservation is after that left unchanged\&. When this flag is set to \fIfalse\fR\&, only virtual address space is reserved for the super carrier upon creation\&. The system attempts to reserve physical memory upon carrier creations in the super carrier, and attempt to unreserve physical memory upon carrier destructions in the super carrier\&.
.LP

What reservation of physical memory means, highly depends on the operating system, and how it is configured\&. For example, different memory overcommit settings on Linux drastically change the behavior\&.

\fI+MMscs <size in MB>\fR\&:
Sets super carrier size (in MB)\&. Defaults to \fI0\fR\&, that is, the super carrier is by default disabled\&. The super carrier is a large continuous area in the virtual address space\&. \fImseg_alloc\fR\& always tries to create new carriers in the super carrier if it exists\&.

\fI+M<S>acul <utilization>|de\fR\&:
Abandon carrier utilization limit\&. A valid \fI<utilization>\fR\& is an integer in the range \fI[0, 100]\fR\& representing utilization in percent\&. When a utilization value > 0 is used, allocator instances are allowed to abandon multiblock carriers\&. If \fIde\fR\& (default enabled) is passed instead of a \fI<utilization>\fR\&, a recommended non-zero utilization value is used\&. The value chosen depends on the allocator type and can be changed between ERTS versions\&. Defaults to \fIde\fR\&, but this can be changed in the future\&.
.RS 2
.LP
Carriers are abandoned when memory utilization in the allocator instance falls below the utilization value used\&. Once a carrier is abandoned, no new allocations are made in it\&. When an allocator instance gets an increased multiblock carrier need, it first tries to fetch an abandoned carrier from an allocator instance of the same allocator type\&. If no abandoned carrier can be fetched, it creates a new empty carrier\&. When an abandoned carrier has been fetched, it will function as an ordinary carrier\&. This feature has special requirements on the \fBallocation strategy\fR\& used\&. Only the strategies \fIaoff\fR\&, \fIaoffcbf\fR\&, \fIaoffcaobf\fR\&, \fIageffcaoff\fR\&m, \fIageffcbf\fR\& and \fIageffcaobf\fR\& support abandoned carriers\&.

This feature also requires \fBmultiple thread specific instances\fR\& to be enabled\&.

\fI+Musac <bool>\fR\&:
Allow \fIsys_alloc\fR\& carriers\&. Defaults to \fItrue\fR\&\&. If set to \fIfalse\fR\&, \fIsys_alloc\fR\& carriers are never created by allocators using the \fIalloc_util\fR\& framework\&.

\fI+Mlpm all|no\fR\&:
Lock physical memory\&. Defaults to \fIno\fR\&, that is, no physical memory is locked\&. If set to \fIall\fR\&, all memory mappings made by the runtime system are locked into physical memory\&. If set to \fIall\fR\&, the runtime system fails to start if this feature is not supported, the user has not got enough privileges, or the user is not allowed to lock enough physical memory\&. The runtime system also fails with an out of memory condition if the user limit on the amount of locked memory is reached\&.

\fIerts_alloc\fR\& is not obliged to strictly use the settings that have been passed to it (it can even ignore them)\&.

.LP
The \fB\fIerts_alloc_config(3)\fR\&\fR\& tool can be used to aid creation of an \fIerts_alloc\fR\& configuration that is suitable for a limited number of runtime scenarios\&.
