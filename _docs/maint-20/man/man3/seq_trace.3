.SH NAME
seq_trace \- Sequential tracing of messages.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Sequential tracing makes it possible to trace all messages resulting from one initial message\&. Sequential tracing is independent of the ordinary tracing in Erlang, which is controlled by the \fIerlang:trace/3\fR\& BIF\&. For more information about what sequential tracing is and how it can be used, see section \fBSequential Tracing\fR\&\&.
.LP
\fIseq_trace\fR\& provides functions that control all aspects of sequential tracing\&. There are functions for activation, deactivation, inspection, and for collection of the trace output\&.

Sets the trace token for the calling process to \fIToken\fR\&\&. If \fIToken == []\fR\& then tracing is disabled, otherwise \fIToken\fR\& should be an Erlang term returned from \fIget_token/0\fR\& or \fIset_token/1\fR\&\&. \fIset_token/1\fR\& can be used to temporarily exclude message passing from the trace by setting the trace token to empty like this:
.LP
.nf

OldToken = seq_trace:set_token([]), % set to empty and save 
                                    % old value
% do something that should not be part of the trace
io:format("Exclude the signalling caused by this~n"),
seq_trace:set_token(OldToken), % activate the trace token again

A trace token flag (\fItrue | false\fR\&) which enables/disables a strict monotonic timestamp to be generated for each traced event\&. Default is \fIfalse\fR\&\&. Timestamps will consist of \fBErlang monotonic time\fR\& and a monotonically increasing integer\&. The time-stamp has the same format and value as produced by \fI{erlang:monotonic_time(nanosecond), erlang:unique_integer([monotonic])}\fR\&\&.

\fIset_token(monotonic_timestamp, Bool)\fR\&:
A trace token flag (\fItrue | false\fR\&) which enables/disables a strict monotonic timestamp to be generated for each traced event\&. Default is \fIfalse\fR\&\&. Timestamps will use \fBErlang monotonic time\fR\&\&. The time-stamp has the same format and value as produced by \fIerlang:monotonic_time(nanosecond)\fR\&\&.
.RE
.LP
If multiple timestamp flags are passed, \fItimestamp\fR\& has precedence over \fIstrict_monotonic_timestamp\fR\& which in turn has precedence over \fImonotonic_timestamp\fR\&\&. All timestamp flags are remembered, so if two are passed and the one with highest precedence later is disabled the other one will become active\&.

.SH "SEQUENTIAL TRACING"

.LP
Sequential tracing is a way to trace a sequence of messages sent between different local or remote processes, where the sequence is initiated by a single message\&. In short, it works as follows:
.LP
Each process has a \fItrace token\fR\&, which can be empty or not empty\&. When not empty, the trace token can be seen as the tuple \fI{Label, Flags, Serial, From}\fR\&\&. The trace token is passed invisibly with each message\&.
.LP
To start a sequential trace, the user must explicitly set the trace token in the process that will send the first message in a sequence\&.
.LP
The trace token of a process is set each time the process matches a message in a receive statement, according to the trace token carried by the received message, empty or not\&.
.LP
On each Erlang node, a process can be set as the \fIsystem tracer\fR\&\&. This process will receive trace messages each time a message with a trace token is sent or received (if the trace token flag \fIsend\fR\& or \fI\&'receive\&'\fR\& is set)\&. The system tracer can then print each trace event, write it to a file, or whatever suitable\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
The system tracer only receives those trace events that occur locally within the Erlang node\&. To get the whole picture of a sequential trace, involving processes on many Erlang nodes, the output from the system tracer on each involved node must be merged (offline)\&.

.LP
The following sections describe sequential tracing and its most fundamental concepts\&.
.SH "TRACE TOKEN"

.LP
Each process has a current trace token\&. Initially, the token is empty\&. When the process sends a message to another process, a copy of the current token is sent "invisibly" along with the message\&.
.LP
The current token of a process is set in one of the following two ways:
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
Explicitly by the process itself, through a call to \fIseq_trace:set_token/1,2\fR\&
.LP
.TP 2
*
When a message is received
.LP
.RE

.LP
In both cases, the current token is set\&. In particular, if the token of a received message is empty, the current token of the process is set to empty\&.
.LP
A trace token contains a label and a set of flags\&. Both the label and the flags are set in both alternatives above\&.
.SH "SERIAL"

.LP
The trace token contains a component called \fIserial\fR\&\&. It consists of two integers, \fIPrevious\fR\& and \fICurrent\fR\&\&. The purpose is to uniquely identify each traced event within a trace sequence, as well as to order the messages chronologically and in the different branches, if any\&.
.LP
The algorithm for updating \fISerial\fR\& can be described as follows:
.LP
Let each process have two counters, \fIprev_cnt\fR\& and \fIcurr_cnt\fR\&, both are set to \fI0\fR\& when a process is created\&. The counters are updated at the following occasions:
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
\fIWhen the process is about to send a message and the trace token is not empty\&.\fR\&
.RS 2
.LP
Let the serial of the trace token be \fItprev\fR\& and \fItcurr\fR\&\&.
.RE
.LP
.nf

curr_cnt := curr_cnt + 1
tprev := prev_cnt
tcurr := curr_cnt
.fi
.RS 2
.LP
The trace token with \fItprev\fR\& and \fItcurr\fR\& is then passed along with the message\&.
.RE
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fIWhen the process calls\fR\& \fIseq_trace:print(Label, Info)\fR\&, \fILabel\fR\& \fImatches the label part of the trace token and the trace token print flag is \fItrue\fR\&\&.\fR\&
.RS 2
.LP
The algorithm is the same as for send above\&.
.RE
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fIWhen a message is received and contains a non-empty trace token\&.\fR\&
.RS 2
.LP
The process trace token is set to the trace token from the message\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
Let the serial of the trace token be \fItprev\fR\& and \fItcurr\fR\&\&.
.RE
.LP
.nf

if (curr_cnt < tcurr )
   curr_cnt := tcurr
prev_cnt := tcurr
.fi
.LP
.RE

.LP
\fIcurr_cnt\fR\& of a process is incremented each time the process is involved in a sequential trace\&. The counter can reach its limit (27 bits) if a process is very long-lived and is involved in much sequential tracing\&. If the counter overflows, the serial for ordering of the trace events cannot be used\&. To prevent the counter from overflowing in the middle of a sequential trace, function \fIseq_trace:reset_trace/0\fR\& can be called to reset \fIprev_cnt\fR\& and \fIcurr_cnt\fR\& of all processes in the Erlang node\&. This function also sets all trace tokens in processes and their message queues to empty, and thus stops all ongoing sequential tracing\&.
.SH "PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS"

.LP
The performance degradation for a system that is enabled for sequential tracing is negligible as long as no tracing is activated\&. When tracing is activated, there is an extra cost for each traced message, but all other messages are unaffected\&.
.SH "PORTS"

.LP
Sequential tracing is not performed across ports\&.
.LP
If the user for some reason wants to pass the trace token to a port, this must be done manually in the code of the port controlling process\&. The port controlling processes have to check the appropriate sequential trace settings (as obtained from \fIseq_trace:get_token/1\fR\&) and include trace information in the message data sent to their respective ports\&.
.LP
Similarly, for messages received from a port, a port controller has to retrieve trace-specific information, and set appropriate sequential trace flags through calls to \fIseq_trace:set_token/2\fR\&\&.
.SH "DISTRIBUTION"

.LP
Sequential tracing between nodes is performed transparently\&. This applies to C-nodes built with \fIErl_Interface\fR\& too\&. A C-node built with \fIErl_Interface\fR\& only maintains one trace token, which means that the C-node appears as one process from the sequential tracing point of view\&.
.SH "EXAMPLE OF USE"

.LP
This example gives a rough idea of how the new primitives can be used and what kind of output it produces\&.
.LP
Assume that you have an initiating process with \fIPid == <0\&.30\&.0>\fR\& like this:
.LP
.nf

-module(seqex).
-compile(export_all).

loop(Port) ->
    receive 
        {Port,Message} ->
            seq_trace:set_token(label,17),
            seq_trace:set_token('receive',true),
            seq_trace:set_token(print,true),
            seq_trace:print(17,"**** Trace Started ****"),
            call_server ! {self(),the_message};
        {ack,Ack} ->
            ok
    end,
    loop(Port).
.fi
.LP
And a registered process \fIcall_server\fR\& with \fIPid == <0\&.31\&.0>\fR\& like this:
.LP
.nf

loop() ->
    receive
        {PortController,Message} ->
            Ack = {received, Message},
            seq_trace:print(17,"We are here now"),
            PortController ! {ack,Ack}
    end,
    loop().
.fi
.LP
A possible output from the system\&'s \fIsequential_tracer\fR\& can be like this:
.LP
.nf

17:<0.30.0> Info {0,1} WITH
"**** Trace Started ****"
17:<0.31.0> Received {0,2} FROM <0.30.0> WITH
{<0.30.0>,the_message}
17:<0.31.0> Info {2,3} WITH
"We are here now"
17:<0.30.0> Received {2,4} FROM <0.31.0> WITH
{ack,{received,the_message}}
.fi
.LP
The implementation of a system tracer process that produces this printout can look like this:
.LP
.nf

tracer() ->
    receive
        {seq_trace,Label,TraceInfo} ->
           print_trace(Label,TraceInfo,false);
        {seq_trace,Label,TraceInfo,Ts} ->
           print_trace(Label,TraceInfo,Ts);
        Other -> ignore
    end,
    tracer().        

print_trace(Label,TraceInfo,false) ->
    io:format("~p:",[Label]),
    print_trace(TraceInfo);
print_trace(Label,TraceInfo,Ts) ->
    io:format("~p ~p:",[Label,Ts]),
    print_trace(TraceInfo).

print_trace({print,Serial,From,_,Info}) ->
    io:format("~p Info ~p WITH~n~p~n", [From,Serial,Info]);
print_trace({'receive',Serial,From,To,Message}) ->
    io:format("~p Received ~p FROM ~p WITH~n~p~n", 
              [To,Serial,From,Message]);
print_trace({send,Serial,From,To,Message}) ->
    io:format("~p Sent ~p TO ~p WITH~n~p~n", 
              [From,Serial,To,Message]).
.fi
.LP
The code that creates a process that runs this tracer function and sets that process as the system tracer can look like this:
.LP
.nf

start() ->
    Pid = spawn(?MODULE,tracer,[]),
    seq_trace:set_system_tracer(Pid), % set Pid as the system tracer 
    ok.
.fi
.LP
With a function like \fItest/0\fR\&, the whole example can be started:
.LP
.nf

test() ->
    P = spawn(?MODULE, loop, [port]),
    register(call_server, spawn(?MODULE, loop, [])),
    start(),
    P ! {port,message}.
.fi
