.SH NAME
crypto \- The Crypto Application
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The purpose of the Crypto application is to provide an Erlang API to cryptographic functions, see \fBcrypto(3)\fR\&\&. Note that the API is on a fairly low level and there are some corresponding API functions available in \fBpublic_key(3)\fR\&, on a higher abstraction level, that uses the crypto application in its implementation\&.
.SH "DEPENDENCIES"

.LP
The current crypto implementation uses nifs to interface OpenSSLs crypto library and may work with limited functionality with as old versions as \fIOpenSSL\fR\& 0\&.9\&.8c\&. FIPS mode support requires at least version 1\&.0\&.1 and a FIPS capable OpenSSL installation\&. We recommend using a version that is officially supported by the OpenSSL project\&. API compatible backends like LibreSSL should also work\&.
.LP
Source releases of OpenSSL can be downloaded from the OpenSSL project home page, or mirror sites listed there\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"

.LP
The following configuration parameters are defined for the crypto application\&. See \fIapp(3)\fR\& for more information about configuration parameters\&.
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fIfips_mode = boolean()\fR\&:
Specifies whether to run crypto in FIPS mode\&. This setting will take effect when the nif module is loaded\&. If FIPS mode is requested but not available at run time the nif module and thus the crypto module will fail to load\&. This mechanism prevents the accidental use of non-validated algorithms\&.
