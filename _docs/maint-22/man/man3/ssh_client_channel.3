Note:
.RE
This module replaces ssh_channel\&.
.LP
The old module is still available for compatibility, but should not be used for new programs\&. The old module will not be maintained except for some error corrections

.LP
SSH services (clients and servers) are implemented as channels that are multiplexed over an SSH connection and communicates over the  SSH Connection Protocol\&. This module provides a callback API that takes care of generic channel aspects for clients, such as flow control and close messages\&. It lets the callback functions take care of the service (application) specific parts\&. This behavior also ensures that the channel process honors the principal of an OTP-process so that it can be part of a supervisor tree\&. This is a requirement of channel processes implementing a subsystem that will be added to the \fIssh\fR\& applications supervisor tree\&.

When implementing a \fIssh\fR\& subsystem for daemons, use \fB-behaviour(ssh_server_channel)\fR\& (Replaces ssh_daemon_channel) instead\&.

Makes a synchronous call to the channel process by sending a message and waiting until a reply arrives, or a time-out occurs\&. The channel calls \fBModule:handle_call/3\fR\& to handle the message\&. If the channel process does not exist, \fI{error, closed}\fR\& is returned\&.

Makes an existing process an \fIssh_client_channel\fR\& (replaces ssh_channel) process\&. Does not return, instead the calling process enters the \fIssh_client_channel\fR\& (replaces ssh_channel) process receive loop and become an \fIssh_client_channel\fR\& process\&. The process must have been started using one of the start functions in \fIproc_lib\fR\&, see the \fBproc_lib(3)\fR\& manual page in STDLIB\&. The user is responsible for any initialization of the process and must call \fBinit/1\fR\&\&.

\fIClient\fR\& must be the \fIFrom\fR\& argument provided to the callback function \fIhandle_call/3\fR\&\&. \fIReply\fR\& is an arbitrary term, which is given back to the client as the return value of \fBcall/[2,3]\&.\fR\&

The timeout values that can be returned by the callback functions have the same semantics as in a \fBgen_server\fR\&\&. If the time-out occurs, \fBhandle_msg/2\fR\& is called as \fIhandle_msg(timeout, State)\fR\&\&.

This function is called by a client-side channel when it is to update its internal state during a release upgrade or downgrade, that is, when the instruction \fI{update,Module,Change,\&.\&.\&.}\fR\&, where \fIChange={advanced,Extra}\fR\&, is given in the \fIappup\fR\& file\&.

Note:
.RE
Soft upgrade according to the OTP release concept is not straight forward for the server side, as subsystem channel processes are spawned by the \fIssh\fR\& application and hence added to its supervisor tree\&. The subsystem channels can be upgraded when upgrading the user application, if the callback functions can handle two versions of the state, but this function cannot be used in the normal way\&.
