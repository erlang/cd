.SH NAME
ets \- Built-in term storage.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This module is an interface to the Erlang built-in term storage BIFs\&. These provide the ability to store very large quantities of data in an Erlang runtime system, and to have constant access time to the data\&. (In the case of \fIordered_set\fR\&, see below, access time is proportional to the logarithm of the number of stored objects\&.)
.LP
Data is organized as a set of dynamic tables, which can store tuples\&. Each table is created by a process\&. When the process terminates, the table is automatically destroyed\&. Every table has access rights set at creation\&.
.LP
Tables are divided into four different types, \fIset\fR\&, \fIordered_set\fR\&, \fIbag\fR\&, and \fIduplicate_bag\fR\&\&. A \fIset\fR\& or \fIordered_set\fR\& table can only have one object associated with each key\&. A \fIbag\fR\& or \fIduplicate_bag\fR\& table can have many objects associated with each key\&.
.LP

.RS -4

Note:
.RE
The number of tables stored at one Erlang node \fIused\fR\& to be limited\&. This is no longer the case (except by memory usage)\&. The previous default limit was about 1400 tables and could be increased by setting the environment variable \fIERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES\fR\& or the command line option \fI+e\fR\& before starting the Erlang runtime system\&. This hard limit has been removed, but it is currently useful to set the \fIERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES\fR\& anyway\&. It should be set to an approximate of the maximum amount of tables used\&. This since an internal table for named tables is sized using this value\&. If large amounts of named tables are used and \fIERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES\fR\& hasn\&'t been increased, the performance of named table lookup will degrade\&.

.LP
Notice that there is no automatic garbage collection for tables\&. Even if there are no references to a table from any process, it is not automatically destroyed unless the owner process terminates\&. To destroy a table explicitly, use function \fIdelete/1\fR\&\&. The default owner is the process that created the table\&. To transfer table ownership at process termination, use option \fIheir\fR\& or call \fIgive_away/3\fR\&\&.
.LP
Some implementation details:
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
In the current implementation, every object insert and look-up operation results in a copy of the object\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fI\&'$end_of_table\&'\fR\& is not to be used as a key, as this atom is used to mark the end of the table when using functions \fIfirst/1\fR\& and \fInext/2\fR\&\&.
.LP
.RE

.LP
Notice the subtle difference between \fImatching\fR\& and \fIcomparing equal\fR\&, which is demonstrated by table types \fIset\fR\& and \fIordered_set\fR\&:
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
Two Erlang terms \fImatch\fR\& if they are of the same type and have the same value, so that \fI1\fR\& matches \fI1\fR\&, but not \fI1\&.0\fR\& (as \fI1\&.0\fR\& is a \fIfloat()\fR\& and not an \fIinteger()\fR\&)\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
Two Erlang terms \fIcompare equal\fR\& if they either are of the same type and value, or if both are numeric types and extend to the same value, so that \fI1\fR\& compares equal to both \fI1\fR\& and \fI1\&.0\fR\&\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
The \fIordered_set\fR\& works on the \fIErlang term order\fR\& and no defined order exists between an \fIinteger()\fR\& and a \fIfloat()\fR\& that extends to the same value\&. Hence the key \fI1\fR\& and the key \fI1\&.0\fR\& are regarded as equal in an \fIordered_set\fR\& table\&.

.RE
.SH "CONCURRENCY"

.LP
This module provides some limited support for concurrent access\&. All updates to single objects are guaranteed to be both \fIatomic\fR\& and \fIisolated\fR\&\&. This means that an updating operation to a single object either succeeds or fails completely without any effect (atomicity) and that no intermediate results of the update can be seen by other processes (isolation)\&. Some functions that update many objects state that they even guarantee atomicity and isolation for the entire operation\&. In database terms the isolation level can be seen as "serializable", as if all isolated operations are carried out serially, one after the other in a strict order\&.
.SH "TABLE TRAVERSAL"

.LP
There are different ways to traverse through the objects of a table\&.
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
\fISingle-step\fR\& traversal one key at at time, using \fIfirst/1\fR\&, \fInext/2\fR\&, \fIlast/1\fR\& and \fIprev/2\fR\&\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
Search with simple \fImatch patterns\fR\&, using \fImatch/1/2/3\fR\&, \fImatch_delete/2\fR\& and \fImatch_object/1/2/3\fR\&\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
Search with more powerful \fImatch specifications\fR\&, using \fIselect/1/2/3\fR\&, \fIselect_count/2\fR\&, \fIselect_delete/2\fR\&, \fIselect_replace/2\fR\& and \fIselect_reverse/1/2/3\fR\&\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fITable conversions\fR\&, using \fItab2file/2/3\fR\& and \fItab2list/1\fR\&\&.
.LP
.RE

.LP
None of these ways of table traversal will guarantee a consistent table snapshot if the table is also updated during the traversal\&. Moreover, traversals not done in a \fIsafe\fR\& way, on tables where keys are inserted or deleted during the traversal, may yield the following undesired effects:
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
Any key may be missed\&.
.LP
.TP 2

Any key may be found more than once\&.
.LP

.LP
.RE

.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
Even though the access of a single object is always guaranteed to be atomic and isolated, each traversal through a table to find the next key is not done with such guarantees\&. This is often not a problem, but may cause rare subtle "unexpected" effects if a concurrent process inserts objects during a traversal\&. For example, consider one process doing
.LP
.nf

ets:new(t, [ordered_set, named_table]),
ets:insert(t, {1}),
ets:insert(t, {2}),
ets:insert(t, {3}),

.fi
.LP
A concurrent call to \fIets:first(t)\fR\&, done by another process, may then in rare cases return \fI2\fR\& even though \fI2\fR\& has never existed in the table ordered as the first key\&. In the same way, a concurrent call to \fIets:next(t, 1)\fR\& may return \fI3\fR\& even though \fI3\fR\& never existed in the table ordered directly after \fI1\fR\&\&.
.LP
Effects like this are improbable but possible\&. The probability will further be reduced (if not vanish) if table option \fIwrite_concurrency\fR\& is not enabled\&. This can also only be a potential concern for \fIordered_set\fR\& where the traversal order is defined\&.

.LP
Traversals using \fImatch\fR\& and \fIselect\fR\& functions may not need to scan the entire table depending on how the key is specified\&. A match pattern with a \fIfully bound key\fR\& (without any match variables) will optimize the operation to a single key lookup without any table traversal at all\&. For \fIordered_set\fR\& a \fIpartially bound key\fR\& will limit the traversal to only scan a subset of the table based on term order\&. A partially bound key is either a list or a tuple with a prefix that is fully bound\&. Example:
.LP
.nf

1> T = ets:new(t,[ordered_set]), ets:insert(T, {"555-1234", "John Smith"})\&.
true
2> %% Efficient search of all with area code 555
2> ets:match(T,{[$5,$5,$5,$- |\&'$1\&'],\&'$2\&'})\&.
[["1234","John Smith"]]

.SH "MATCH SPECIFICATIONS"

.LP
The only supported option is \fI{verify,boolean()}\fR\&\&. If verification is turned on (by specifying \fI{verify,true}\fR\&), the function uses whatever information is present in the file to assert that the information is not damaged\&. How this is done depends on which \fIextended_info\fR\& was written using \fItab2file/3\fR\&\&.
.LP
If no \fIextended_info\fR\& is present in the file and \fI{verify,true}\fR\& is specified, the number of objects written is compared to the size of the original table when the dump was started\&. This can make verification fail if the table was \fIpublic\fR\& and objects were added or removed while the table was dumped to file\&. To avoid this problem, either do not verify files dumped while updated simultaneously or use option \fI{extended_info, [object_count]}\fR\& to \fItab2file/3\fR\&, which extends the information in the file with the number of objects written\&.
.LP
If verification is turned on and the file was written with option \fI{extended_info, [md5sum]}\fR\&, reading the file is slower and consumes radically more CPU time than otherwise\&.

\fI{verify,false}\fR\& is the default\&.

Pseudo function that by a \fIparse_transform\fR\& translates \fILiteralFun\fR\& typed as parameter in the function call to a match specification\&. With "literal" is meant that the fun must textually be written as the parameter of the function, it cannot be held in a variable that in turn is passed to the function\&.
.LP
The parse transform is provided in the \fIms_transform\fR\& module and the source \fImust\fR\& include file \fIms_transform\&.hrl\fR\& in STDLIB for this pseudo function to work\&. Failing to include the hrl file in the source results in a runtime error, not a compile time error\&. The include file is easiest included by adding line \fI-include_lib("stdlib/include/ms_transform\&.hrl")\&.\fR\& to the source file\&.
.LP
The fun is very restricted, it can take only a single parameter (the object to match): a sole variable or a tuple\&. It must use the \fIis_\fR\& guard tests\&. Language constructs that have no representation in a match specification (\fIif\fR\&, \fIcase\fR\&, \fIreceive\fR\&, and so on) are not allowed\&.

The imported variables are replaced by match specification \fIconst\fR\& expressions, which is consistent with the static scoping for Erlang funs\&.

For tables of type \fIset\fR\& or \fIordered_set\fR\&, the function returns either the empty list or a list with one element, as there cannot be more than one object with the same key\&. For tables of type \fIbag\fR\& or \fIduplicate_bag\fR\&, the function returns a list of arbitrary length\&.

Matches the objects in table \fITab\fR\& using a match specification\&. This is a more general call than \fImatch/2\fR\& and \fImatch_object/2\fR\& calls\&. In its simplest form, the match specification is as follows:
.LP
.nf

MatchSpec = [MatchFunction]
MatchFunction = {MatchHead, [Guard], [Result]}
MatchHead = "Pattern as in ets:match"
Guard = {"Guardtest name", ...}
Result = "Term construct"
.fi
.LP
This means that the match specification is always a list of one or more tuples (of arity 3)\&. The first element of the tuple is to be a pattern as described in \fImatch/2\fR\&\&. The second element of the tuple is to be a list of 0 or more guard tests (described below)\&. The third element of the tuple is to be a list containing a description of the value to return\&. In almost all normal cases, the list contains exactly one term that fully describes the value to return for each object\&.
.LP
The return value is constructed using the "match variables" bound in \fIMatchHead\fR\& or using the special match variables \fI\&'$_\&'\fR\& (the whole matching object) and \fI\&'$$\&'\fR\& (all match variables in a list), so that the following \fImatch/2\fR\& expression:
.LP
.nf

ets:match(Tab,{'$1','$2','$3'})
.fi
.LP
is exactly equivalent to:
.LP
.nf

ets:select(Tab,[{{'$1','$2','$3'},[],['$$']}])
.fi
.LP
And that the following \fImatch_object/2\fR\& call:
.LP
.nf

ets:match_object(Tab,{'$1','$2','$1'})
.fi
.LP
is exactly equivalent to
.LP
.nf

ets:select(Tab,[{{'$1','$2','$1'},[],['$_']}])
.fi
.LP
Composite terms can be constructed in the \fIResult\fR\& part either by simply writing a list, so that the following code:
.LP
.nf

ets:select(Tab,[{{'$1','$2','$3'},[],['$$']}])
.fi
.LP
gives the same output as:
.LP
.nf

ets:select(Tab,[{{'$1','$2','$3'},[],[['$1','$2','$3']]}])
.fi
.LP
That is, all the bound variables in the match head as a list\&. If tuples are to be constructed, one has to write a tuple of arity 1 where the single element in the tuple is the tuple one wants to construct (as an ordinary tuple can be mistaken for a \fIGuard\fR\&)\&.
.LP
Therefore the following call:
.LP
.nf

ets:select(Tab,[{{'$1','$2','$1'},[],['$_']}])
.fi
.LP
gives the same output as:
.LP
.nf

ets:select(Tab,[{{'$1','$2','$1'},[],[{{'$1','$2','$3'}}]}])
.fi
.LP
This syntax is equivalent to the syntax used in the trace patterns (see the \fIdbg(3)\fR\&) module in Runtime_Tools\&.
.LP
The \fIGuard\fR\&s are constructed as tuples, where the first element is the test name and the remaining elements are the test parameters\&. To check for a specific type (say a list) of the element bound to the match variable \fI\&'$1\&'\fR\&, one would write the test as \fI{is_list, \&'$1\&'}\fR\&\&. If the test fails, the object in the table does not match and the next \fIMatchFunction\fR\& (if any) is tried\&. Most guard tests present in Erlang can be used, but only the new versions prefixed \fIis_\fR\& are allowed (\fIis_float\fR\&, \fIis_atom\fR\&, and so on)\&.
.LP
The \fIGuard\fR\& section can also contain logic and arithmetic operations, which are written with the same syntax as the guard tests (prefix notation), so that the following guard test written in Erlang:
.LP
.nf

is_integer(X), is_integer(Y), X + Y < 4711
.fi
.LP
is expressed as follows (\fIX\fR\& replaced with \fI\&'$1\&'\fR\& and \fIY\fR\& with \fI\&'$2\&'\fR\&):
.LP
.nf

[{is_integer, '$1'}, {is_integer, '$2'}, {'<', {'+', '$1', '$2'}, 4711}]
.fi
.LP
For tables of type \fIordered_set\fR\&, objects are visited in the same order as in a \fIfirst\fR\&/\fInext\fR\& traversal\&.

A table can be traversed by repeatedly calling the function, starting with the first slot \fII=0\fR\& and ending when \fI\&'$end_of_table\&'\fR\& is returned\&.

Unless a table of type \fIset\fR\&, \fIbag\fR\&, or \fIduplicate_bag\fR\& is protected using \fIsafe_fixtable/2\fR\&, a traversal can fail if concurrent updates are made to the table\&. For table type \fIordered_set\fR\&, the function returns a list containing object \fII\fR\& in Erlang term order\&.

Dumps table \fITab\fR\& to file \fIFilename\fR\&\&.
.LP
When dumping the table, some information about the table is dumped to a header at the beginning of the dump\&. This information contains data about the table type, name, protection, size, version, and if it is a named table\&. It also contains notes about what extended information is added to the file, which can be a count of the objects in the file or a MD5 sum of the header and records in the file\&.
.LP
The size field in the header might not correspond to the number of records in the file if the table is public and records are added or removed from the table during dumping\&. Public tables updated during dump, and that one wants to verify when reading, needs at least one field of extended information for the read verification process to be reliable later\&.

\fIname\fR\&:
The name of the dumped table\&. If the table was a named table, a table with the same name cannot exist when the table is loaded from file with \fIfile2tab/2\fR\&\&. If the table is not saved as a named table, this field has no significance when loading the table from file\&.
.TP 2

\fItype\fR\&:
The ETS type of the dumped table (that is, \fIset\fR\&, \fIbag\fR\&, \fIduplicate_bag\fR\&, or \fIordered_set\fR\&)\&. This type is used when loading the table again\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIprotection\fR\&:
The protection of the dumped table (that is, \fIprivate\fR\&, \fIprotected\fR\&, or \fIpublic\fR\&)\&. A table loaded from the file gets the same protection\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fInamed_table\fR\&:
\fItrue\fR\& if the table was a named table when dumped to file, otherwise \fIfalse\fR\&\&. Notice that when a named table is loaded from a file, there cannot exist a table in the system with the same name\&.
.TP 2

\fIkeypos\fR\&:
The \fIkeypos\fR\& of the table dumped to file, which is used when loading the table again\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIsize\fR\&:
The number of objects in the table when the table dump to file started\&. For a \fIpublic\fR\& table, this number does not need to correspond to the number of objects saved to the file, as objects can have been added or deleted by another process during table dump\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIextended_info\fR\&:
The extended information written in the file footer to allow stronger verification during table loading from file, as specified to \fItab2file/3\fR\&\&. Notice that this function only tells \fIwhich\fR\& information is present, not the values in the file footer\&.

\fIversion\fR\&:
A tuple \fI{Major,Minor}\fR\& containing the major and minor version of the file format for ETS table dumps\&. This version field was added beginning with STDLIB 1\&.5\&.1\&. Files dumped with older versions return \fI{0,0}\fR\& in this field\&.

Returns a Query List Comprehension (QLC) query handle\&. The \fIqlc\fR\& module provides a query language aimed mainly at Mnesia, but ETS tables, Dets tables, and lists are also recognized by QLC as sources of data\&. Calling \fItable/1,2\fR\& is the means to make the ETS table \fITab\fR\& usable to QLC\&.
.LP
When there are only simple restrictions on the key position, QLC uses \fIlookup/2\fR\& to look up the keys\&. When that is not possible, the whole table is traversed\&. Option \fItraverse\fR\& determines how this is done:
.RS 2
.TP 2

\fIfirst_next\fR\&:
The table is traversed one key at a time by calling \fIfirst/1\fR\& and \fInext/2\fR\&\&.

The table is traversed one key at a time by calling \fIlast/1\fR\& and \fIprev/2\fR\&\&.
.TP 2

\fIselect\fR\&:
The table is traversed by calling \fIselect/3\fR\& and \fIselect/1\fR\&\&. Option \fIn_objects\fR\& determines the number of objects returned (the third argument of \fIselect/3\fR\&); the default is to return \fI100\fR\& objects at a time\&. The match specification (the second argument of \fIselect/3\fR\&) is assembled by QLC: simple filters are translated into equivalent match specifications while more complicated filters must be applied to all objects returned by \fIselect/3\fR\& given a match specification that matches all objects\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fI{select, MatchSpec}\fR\&:
As for \fIselect\fR\&, the table is traversed by calling \fIselect/3\fR\& and \fIselect/1\fR\&\&. The difference is that the match specification is explicitly specified\&. This is how to state match specifications that cannot easily be expressed within the syntax provided by QLC\&.
