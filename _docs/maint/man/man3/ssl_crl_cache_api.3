.SH NAME
ssl_crl_cache_api \- API for a TLS CRL (Certificate Revocation List) cache.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
When TLS performs certificate path validation according to RFC 5280  it should also perform CRL validation checks\&. To enable the CRL checks the application needs access to CRLs\&. A database of CRLs can be set up in many different ways\&. This module provides the behavior of the API needed to integrate an arbitrary CRL cache with the erlang ssl application\&. It is also used by the application itself to provide a simple default implementation of a CRL cache\&.

Lookup the CRLs belonging to the distribution point \fI Distributionpoint\fR\&\&. This function may choose to only look in the cache or to follow distribution point links depending on how the cache is administrated\&.
.LP
The \fIIssuer\fR\& argument contains the issuer name of the certificate to be checked\&. Normally the returned CRL should be issued by this issuer, except if the \fIcRLIssuer\fR\& field of \fIDistributionPoint\fR\& has a value, in which case that value should be used instead\&.
.LP
In an earlier version of this API, the \fIlookup\fR\& function received two arguments, omitting \fIIssuer\fR\&\&. For compatibility, this is still supported: if there is no \fIlookup/3\fR\& function in the callback module, \fIlookup/2\fR\& is called instead\&.

It is possible to return logger info that will be used by the TLS connection to produce log events\&.

Select the CRLs in the cache that are issued by \fIIssuer\fR\& unless the value is a list of so called general names, see  X509 certificates records, originating form \fI#\&'DistributionPoint\&'\&.cRLissuer\fR\& and representing different mechanism to obtain the CRLs\&. The cache callback needs to use the appropriate entry to retrive the CRLs or return an empty list if it does not exist\&.
