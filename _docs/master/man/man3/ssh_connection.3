.SH NAME
ssh_connection \- 
    This module provides API functions to send SSH Connection Protocol 
    events to the other side of an SSH channel.
  
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The SSH Connection Protocol is used by clients and servers, that is, SSH channels, to communicate over the SSH connection\&. The API functions in this module send SSH Connection Protocol events, which are received as messages by the remote channel handling the remote channel\&. The Erlang format of thoose messages is (see also below):
.LP
\fI{ssh_cm, \fR\&ssh:connection_ref()\fI, \fR\&\fIchannel_msg()\fR\&\fI}\fR\& 
.LP
If the ssh_client_channel behavior is used to implement the channel process, these messages are handled by handle_ssh_msg/2\&.
.SH DATA TYPES
.nf

\fBssh_data_type_code()\fR\& = integer() >= 0
.br
.fi
.RS
.LP
The valid values are \fI0\fR\& ("normal") and \fI1\fR\& ("stderr"), see RFC 4254, Section 5\&.2\&.

\fBreason()\fR\& = closed | timeout
.br
.fi
.RS
.LP
The result of a call\&.
.LP
If the request reached the peer, was handled and the response reached the requesting node the req_status() is the status reported from the peer\&.
.LP
If not, the reason() indicates what went wrong:
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fIclosed\fR\&:
indicates that the channel or connection was closed when trying to send the request 
.TP 2
.B
\fItimeout\fR\&:
indicates that the operation exceeded a time limit 
.RE
.RE
.nf

\fBreq_status()\fR\& = success | failure

As mentioned in the introduction, the SSH Connection Protocol events are handled as messages\&. When writing a channel handling process without using the support by the ssh_client_channel behavior the process must handle thoose messages\&.

Messages that include a \fIWantReply\fR\& expect the channel handling process to call  ssh_connection:reply_request/4 with the boolean value of \fIWantReply\fR\& as the second argument\&.

A pseudo-terminal has been requested for the session\&. \fITerminal\fR\& is the value of the TERM environment variable value, that is, \fIvt100\fR\&\&. Zero dimension parameters must be ignored\&. The character/row dimensions override the pixel dimensions (when non-zero)\&. Pixel dimensions refer to the drawable area of the window\&. \fIOpcode\fR\& in the \fITerminalModes\fR\& list is the mnemonic name, represented as a lowercase Erlang atom, defined in RFC 4254, Section 8\&. It can also be an \fIOpcode\fR\& if the mnemonic name is not listed in the RFC\&. Example: \fIOP code: 53, mnemonic name ECHO erlang atom: echo\fR\&\&.

When the command running at the other end terminates, the following message can be sent to return the exit status of the command\&. A zero \fIexit_status\fR\& usually means that the command terminated successfully\&. This event is sent as a result of calling  ssh_connection:exit_status/3\&.
